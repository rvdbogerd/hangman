# SIM Hangman API #

The goal of this api is quite clear, I've implemented the resources and added test coverage for all code I've created.

For convenience I've added a basic vagrant setup to run the app locally on a VM, it wasn't part of the assignment,
but hey, now my fellow developers will get it for free. That is, if this was a real project :)

## Project setup ##

* Check out the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:rvdbogerd/hangman.git
```

* Run composer install
```
composer install
```

## Webserver option 1: Vagrant ##
* Install vagrant
* Run vagrant up
```
vagrant up --provision
```

* Point your local hosts file to the vm by adding the hangman url
```
192.168.33.60   hangman.local.dev
192.168.33.60   www.hangman.local.dev
```

## Webserver option 2 ##
Just set up a local database, add your credentials to parameters.yml and boot your favourite webserver (tip: you could use the internal php server by running the `app/console server:run` command.

## DB Migrations ##

* run database migrations
```
$ php app/console doctrine:database:create
$ php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

## Start testing ##
* Now you can start testing the API by pointing your testing tool (e.g. Postman) to hangman.local.dev/games

Create new game:
URI: hangman.local.dev/games
Method: POST 
Response content: game data in json format
Response headers: Location header contains the new resource location.

Start guessing characters on existing game:
URI: hangman.local.dev/games/{id}
Method: PUT 
Parameters: 'character' => single alpha character
Request Headers: should contain Content-Type header, can be one of `application/json` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
Response content: game data in json format



# ASSIGNMENT AS PROVIDED #

In this assignment we ask you to implement a minimal version of a hangman API using the following resources below:

## Resources ##

**/games (POST)**

Start a new game

- A list of words can be found in the MySQL database. At the start of the game a random word should be picked from this list.

**/games/[:id] (PUT)**

Guess a started game

- Guessing a correct letter doesnâ€™t decrement the amount of tries left

- Only valid characters are a-z

## Response ##

Every response should contain the following fields:

*word*: representation of the word that is being guessed. Should contain dots for letters that have not been guessed yet (e.g. aw.so..)

*tries_left*: the number of tries left to guess the word (starts at 11)

*status*: current status of the game (busy|fail|success)
